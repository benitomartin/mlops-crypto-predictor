# MLOps LLM Crypto Predictor

![deployment trades](images/deployment_trades2.png)

This is a project to predict crypto prices using Kafka, Kind, Kubernetes, uv, and Quix Streams.

## Initialize the Project

Initialize the project from the root directory. This will create the main `pyproject.toml` file.

```bash
uv init
```

Create a `trades` workspace in the `services` directory. This will create a `pyproject.toml` file in the `trades` workspace, with the `src` layout, and include the `hatchling` build-system. Additionally, it will add the `trades` workspace to the main `pyproject.toml` file.

```bash
cd services
uv init --lib trades
```

### Adding Workspaces

Each service is treated as a separate workspace. The `uv` tool uses the `[tool.uv.workspace]` section to define all workspace members.

To declare a workspace member in the main `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = ["services/trades"]
```

To add a workspace as a dependency, use:

```bash
uv add trades
```

This command does two things:

1. Adds trades to the dependencies list.

1. Adds an entry to the [tool.uv.sources] section in `pyproject.toml`, marking it as a workspace dependency:

   ```toml
   [tool.uv.sources]
   trades = { workspace = true }
   ```

### Adding Dependencies

To add dependencies to the main project, use the following command:

```bash
uv add quixstreams
```

To add local dependencies for development (`dependency-groups`) use the following command:

```bash
uv add --group tests pytest
```

### TA-Lib Installation

TA-Lib is a library for technical analysis of financial data. It is used in the project to calculate technical indicators.

You must install TA-Lib before adding it to the project. To install TA-Lib, follow the instructions on the following link:

https://ta-lib.org/install/#executable-installer-recommended

Then add the package to the project:

```bash
uv add ta-lib
```

### Synchronize the Project

To synchronize the project without installing the dependency groups, use the following command:

```bash
uv sync
```

To synchronize the project and install the dependency groups, use the following command:

```bash
uv sync --all-groups
```

## Setting up Kafka

To setup Kafka, we need first to create a Kind cluster with port mapping.

There are several scripts and folders in the `deployments/dev/kind` directory.

- `kind-with-portmapping.yaml`: This is the Kind configuration file. It includes the port mapping for Kafka.
- `manifests`: This folder contains the Kafka configuration files.
  - `kafka-e11b.yaml`: This is the Kafka configuration file. It includes the port mapping for Kafka. With this file there will be created the **2 Kafka pods** (`dual-role` and `entity-operator`).
  - `kafka-ui-all-in-one.yaml`: This is the Kafka UI configuration file. It includes the port mapping for Kafka UI. This will create the **Kafka UI pod**.
- `install_kafka.sh`: This script installs Kafka using [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io/quickstarts/) that allows to use Kafka in Kubernetes. It uses the `kafka-e11b.yaml` configuration file. With this file there will be created **8 core Kubernetes pods** (kube-system) and the `local-path-storage` pod from Kind to handle persistent storage in the cluster in addition to the pods created in `kafka-e11b.yaml`
- `install_kafka_ui.sh`: This script installs Kafka UI to make it easier to manage Kafka in a Web UI. It uses the `kafka-ui-all-in-one.yaml` configuration file.
- `create_cluster.sh`: This script runs all the previous scripts in order to create the Kind cluster with Kafka and Kafka UI.

Once you run the `create_cluster.sh` script (with docker running), you should see the following output in the `k9s` terminal:

```bash
chmod +x create_cluster.sh
./create_cluster.sh
```

If we type `svc` in the `k9s` terminal, we should see the following output and the port mapping for Kafka and Kafka UI `8080`:

![kafka ui k9s](images/kafka_ui_k9s.png)

To visualize the Kafka UI, it is necessary to forward the port `8080` from the `kafka-ui` service (which communicates internally with the Kafka cluster on port `9092`) to port `8182` (or any other free port) on your local machine. This means that any traffic sent to `http://localhost:8182` on your local machine will be forwarded to the `kafka-ui` service running inside the Kubernetes cluster on port `8080`.

```bash
kubectl -n kafka port-forward svc/kafka-ui 8182:8080
```

> ðŸ’¡**Note**: You can also use `tmux` to run the port-forwarding command in the background and keep it running. For that, you can use the following command:
>
> ```bash
> tmux new-session -d 'kubectl -n kafka port-forward svc/kafka-ui 8182:8080'
> ```
>
> To stop the port-forwarding, you can use the following commands. First check the session number with:
>
> ```bash
> tmux ls
> ```
>
> Then kill the session with:
>
> ```bash
> tmux kill-session -t <session_number>
> ```

Now you can access the Kafka UI in your local machine at `http://localhost:8182` or `http://127.0.0.1:8182`.

You can test the connection to the Kafka broker on TCP port `31234` with the following command:

```bash
nc -vvv localhost 31234
```

### Running a Service

Once you have the Kafka cluster running, you can run the services.

The first service is the `trades` service. This service will connect to the Kraken API and get the trades data in real time. It will then produce the trades data to the Kafka topic `trades`.

The following command will run the `trades` service, and you should see the trades data in the Kafka UI together with the terminal output:

```bash
uv run services/trades/src/trades/main.py
```

### Managing Partitions

By default the number of partitions is 1. If you change the number of partitions from the trades service from 1 to 2, you will see that the trades data is distributed between the two partitions. Only when both partitions have values, you can deploy the candles service with 2 replicas, so that each replica will consume from one partition.

Changing the partitions after the candles service is deployed will not work, because the candles service will not be able to consume from the new partitions and this will rise an error. You will need to delete the candles service and deploy it again with the new number of partitions.

## Makefile

The project includes a Makefile with several useful commands for development and deployment:

1. Kind Cluster Management

   ```bash
   make start-kind-cluster  # Start the Kind cluster with port mapping (or build it if it doesn't exist)
   make stop-kind-cluster   # Stop the Kind cluster
   ```

1. Development Commands

   ```bash
   make dev service=trades             # Run a specific service in development mode
   make build-for-dev service=trades   # Build a service's Docker image for development
   make push-for-dev service=trades    # Push a service's Docker image to the Kind cluster
   make deploy-for-dev service=trades  # Deploy a service to the Kind cluster
   ```

   To verify the deployment, use the following command or use `k9s` terminal:

   ```bash
   kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces
   ```

1. Linting and Formatting

   ```bash
   make ruff    # Run Ruff linter with auto-fix
   make mypy    # Run MyPy static type checker
   make clean   # Clean up cached files and build artifacts
   make all     # Run ruff, mypy, and clean in sequence
   ```

1. Help Command

   ```bash
   make help    # Display all available make commands with descriptions
   ```

## Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency. To install the pre-commit hooks, run the following command:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

To update the pre-commit hooks to the latest versions, run the following command:

```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```

To run the pre-commit hooks manually, run the following command:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Kafka UI (Prod)

The Kafka UI is available at the following URL:

<https://kafka-ui.ll-4be9.com/>

## Metrics Server

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
```
